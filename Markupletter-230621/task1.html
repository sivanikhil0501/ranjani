    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p>Dear Eileen,<br>
        Thank you for recent application to join us at the University of Awesomes science faculty to study as part of
        your Phd next year. I will answer your question onr by onr,in the following sections.<br></p>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any timw,however ot would suit us better if you
        could start at the
        beginning of a semester;the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First sem:
            <date>9 sep 2016</date>
        </li>
        <li>Second sem:
            <date>15 Jan 2017</date>
        </li>
        <li>Third sem:
            <date>2 May 2017</date>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com"  target = " _blank"> important University
            Dates</a>on our website.</p>

    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility â€“ as long as the subjects fall
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
        by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), when the
            audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your
        question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance
            around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in
            imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements.
            One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
        </dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
            discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants
            of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later
            on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
    <p>Dr Eleanor Gaye</p>
